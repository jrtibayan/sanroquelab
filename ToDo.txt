// 1. create schema for results = collection of results
// 1. create test input
2. each test group will be a document except the chemistry  where all of them will be one result only
                {
                  testCategoryId: 'chemId',
                  testGroupId: 'chemTestId1',
                  price: 100
                },
                {
                  testCategoryId: 'chemId',
                  testGroupId: 'chemTestId2',
                  price: 200
                },
                {
                  testCategoryId: 'hemaId',
                  testGroupId: 'hemaTestId1',
                  price: 1000
                }
3. this will be done using loop
    if testcategory == chem
        if already in collection
            dont add
        else
            add new document for group test
                properties of the document will be the different parameters for each testGroup
    else
        add new document for group test
            properties of the document will be the different parameters for each testGroup

4. since each document already have parameters, to input the results user must select a testGroup and submit a request
5 the request will return all the fields that is needed and depending on the returned fields those input boxes for those fields will be the only ones shown. 
6 since only the needed parameters are shown we only submit those and save the values to the database

// since we can add transaction, discount and payment,
        we can now start with inputing for the report

/cannot add discount if payment is already applied
/cannot add discount if discount already applied
